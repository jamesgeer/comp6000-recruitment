            <h3 class="subtitle">
                Are you a motivated and hardworking individual who is tired of being in ‚Äúsolo‚Äù groups where you feel
                like you are the only one doing any work? Well, we‚Äôre looking for you!
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                We are a laid-back group who are trying to achieve the best possible grade for our degree.
                We understand that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and we want to use our individual
                strengths to make the team stronger by bouncing ideas off each other; sharing thoughts that we had not
                yet considered.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                You do not need to be an expert programmer to join our team. We instead are looking for someone who
                can work independently to resolve a problem, and know when to escalate or ask for help when needed.
                Someone who is motivated to improve, to see a problem and think: ‚Äúthis could be better‚Äù,
                to know: ‚ÄúI do not quite understand this, I am going to learn how this works‚Äù; someone who is
                open-minded to others' ideas and new technologies. But most of all, to strive to do their very best
                to get the highest mark that they can possibly attain. We want to support each other so that we can
                all succeed, but only if you are willing to pull your weight.

                Using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">Node.js</a>,
                we will be heavily expanding the feature set of an existing open-source
                project, which is currently being maintained by a CompSci lecturer. These tasks will involve working
                with APIs, Web Scraping, UI Improvement, Database Integration, Automation, and more.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                This project touches upon every level of the JavaScript tech stack, giving you an exciting and
                diverse set of problems to solve, while also giving you a very valuable, and marketable skill set
                for when you graduate.

                We will be using the following languages and technologies:

                The above is not a comprehensive list as additional packages and libraries will also be used,
                but broadly, an understanding of JavaScript and having the ability to read the documentation
                (or StackOverFlow), should be enough.

                        completed by the set time. If not, we need to know that you can communicate the problem or when the
                        completion of the feature may be expected.

                        when to skillfully add comments. Code quality should be your priority and to not be afraid to refactor

                                    coding after suffering from its wrath for so long, and now I‚Äôve been consumed by it.
