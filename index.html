            <h3 class="subtitle">
                Are you a motivated and hardworking individual who is tired of being in “solo” groups where you feel
                like you are the only one doing any work? Well, we’re looking for you!
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                We are a laid-back group who are trying to achieve the best possible grade for our degree.
                We understand that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and we want to use our individual
                strengths to make the team stronger by bouncing ideas off each other; sharing thoughts that we had not
                yet considered; and introducing a language or concept that opens a blocked passage.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                You do not need to be an expert programmer to join our team. We instead are looking for someone who
                can work independently to resolve a problem, and know when to escalate or ask for help when needed.
                Someone who is motivated to improve, to see a problem and think: “this could be better”,
                to know: “I do not quite understand this, I am going to learn how this works”; someone who is
                open-minded to others' ideas and new technologies. But most of all, to strive to do their very best
                to get the highest mark that they can possibly attain. We want to support each other so that we can
                all succeed, but only if you are willing to put in your weight.

            <h2 class="title is-spaced">Technical</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">
                Although we have not yet decided on a project initiative, being familiar with Java is a must,
                alongside Gitlab, Git, and a database language (SQL). If you have any weaknesses with these we
                expect you to let us know so we can provide training if required. Commits should be well named,
                small, and frequent.

                        Excellent communication skills: we will be using WhatsApp, email, and weekly in-person meetings
                        for our communication.

                    <li>
                        Time management skills: to meet our deadlines, a feature may require your part to be completed before
                        another team member can progress, thus we need to be able to set you a task and know that it will be
                        completed by the set time. If not, we need to know that you can communicate the problem or when the
                        completion of the feature may be expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean code principles: we are looking for someone who can follow good naming practices, to have
                        “self-documenting” code where the variable and method names are clear, and understandable and know
                        when to skillfully add comments. Code quality should be your priority and to not be afraid to refactor
                        when code starts to smell.

                                    Web Agency and two of those years I spent as a Graphic Designer. I grew to love
                                    coding after suffering at its wrath for so long, and now I’ve been consumed by it.
                                    Talk to me about functional programming, Japan or how much you hate JavaScript.

                                    (for better or worse) and I’m looking forward to learning some Python
